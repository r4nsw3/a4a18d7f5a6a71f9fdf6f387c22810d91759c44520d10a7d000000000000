  |   Get Ready to Go Prehistoric! The Back N. Time Grand Prix is coming    |
  |   to Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled on August 2nd!                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Players have been racing, power-sliding, boosting, and battling       |
  |   their way through the Nitro Tour Grand Prix in order to unlock all    |
  |   the sweet rewards found in their Nitro Gauge and in the Pit Stop.     |
  |   They've raced on a brand-new track, Twilight Tour, which has given    |
  |   them a look at the Ancient Middle East inspired by levels from        |
  |   Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped. They've also competed with sweet new       |
  |   rides, like the Rocket Kart, which they've decked out with            |
  |   international flair to rep their country in style.                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   With the Back N. Time Grand Prix, N. Tropy's time-bending staff has   |
  |   thrown Crash and the gang back to the days when dinosaurs roamed      |
  |   the land - and they soon find out things looked much more...          |
  |   fake... back in these Prehistoric times. As with the first, this      |
  |   Grand Prix season will come with new characters, skins, karts,        |
  |   customization items, and of course, a new track. After the start of   |
  |   the Grand Prix, all players should have to do is boot up the game,    |
  |   download the game update (which starts automatically in most          |
  |   cases), and they're ready to jump in!                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Let's dive into each of the Back N. Time Grand Prix's offerings:      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Prehistoric Playground.                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Behold the wonder of Prehistoric Playground! The new track for the    |
  |   Back N. Time Grand Prix will immerse racers in an epic world with     |
  |   Jurassic-sized flora, violent geysers bursting from the ground,       |
  |   caves with mysterious wall-paintings, and of course, giant            |
  |   dinosaurs roaming the land. There are also some other, strangely      |
  |   familiar, characters throughout - let's just say that Fake Crash      |
  |   would feel very comfortable in this Prehistoric world home to an      |
  |   ancient tribe that bears a striking resemblance....                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Ramp yourself off a "Fake" Diplodocus' tail, launch into the air      |
  |   with one of the violent geysers, get ahead with one of the track's    |
  |   shortcuts - be ready for a dynamic new racing experience with         |
  |   Prehistoric Playground!                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Earn your way to Stone Aged rewards.                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The Back N. Time Grand Prix will bring a whole new suite of rewards   |
  |   that players can earn by completing challenges and filling their      |
  |   Nitro Gauge. New items include the Nostalginator and Mammoth Karts,   |
  |   the "Dashing" Fake Crash skin, and Cave Painting stickers. Baby T.    |
  |   will also make his debut in CTR as a Grand Prix reward character      |
  |   for completing the Bronze Tier of the Nitro Gauge, with a "Fake"      |
  |   Baby T. skin being the final item in the Gold Tier.                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   With 18 new items to earn through your Nitro Gauge, be ready to       |
  |   complete those challenges and earn those Nitro Points.                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   New Characters, Karts, and Styles in the Pit Stop.                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   And if that wasn't enough, the Pit Stop will be filled with new       |
  |   characters, karts, skins, and kart customization items for players    |
  |   to unlock and show off a whole new style. Highlighting the            |
  |   additions are a couple of adorable, tiny versions of Crash and        |
  |   Coco. There has been a rift in the space-time continuum on the        |
  |   journey back in time, bringing infant versions of Crash and Coco to   |
  |   the Stone Age! Don't let the pacifiers fool you, though... Baby       |
  |   Crash and Coco are ready to wreak some havoc on the racetrack!        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   It's true that we're going Back N. Time during this Grand Prix        |
  |   season, but we can't do so without bringing some futuristic flair.    |
  |   During this Grand Prix, players will be able to unlock the Probulot   |
  |   2000 in the Pit Stop, the beloved kart from Crash Tag Team Racing.    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   New skins, like Mad Scientist Crash, Sabertooth Pura, and Stone Age   |
  |   N. Tropy (to name a few) will be making their way to the Pit Stop     |
  |   so that players will be able to give some of their favorite           |
  |   characters a fresh look. There will also be ways to intimidate the    |
  |   competition all around the track with new kart customization items    |
  |   like the flame-flaring Lava Rock Wheels.                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   As always, the Pit Stop will be stocked with new and returning        |
  |   characters and cosmetic items, which players can unlock using Wumpa   |
  |   Coins. With all this content available, there will also now be a      |
  |   way for players to fast-track their Wumpa Coin collection if they     |
  |   like. Starting in early August, players will have the option to       |
  |   purchase Wumpa Coin bundles from their game console stores to         |
  |   supplement the Coins they earn by playing. This option won't change   |
  |   the game's core mechanics - players will still earn Wumpa Coins by    |
  |   playing the game in any mode, just as before. They will just able     |
  |   to purchase additional coins if they choose.                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   New Challenges for a historic season.                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Now that you know more about the new items and rewards coming with    |
  |   the Back N. Time Grand Prix, let's talk about the challenges          |
  |   players will take part in to earn Nitro Points and fill up their      |
  |   Nitro Gauges.                                                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   In this Grand Prix, the Quick, Daily, Weekly, Themed, and Pro         |
  |   challenge sets will return, with many of the same challenges that     |
  |   fans remember from the Nitro Tour Grand Prix. There will also be      |
  |   new challenges scattered throughout for players to face. There will   |
  |   be more straightforward new challenges like Power Slide Master        |
  |   where players have to power slide for a certain duration of time.     |
  |   There are also new challenges that will test players' mettle, like    |
  |   Backward Compatible, where the player must complete a lap with the    |
  |   reverse camera on the entire time.                                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Climbing up the Back N. Time Leaderboards.                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Finally, get ready to climb back up those leaderboards! Both the      |
  |   Championship and Nitro Leaderboards will be back and refreshed in     |
  |   the Back N. Time Grand Prix. As a quick reminder the Championship     |
  |   Leaderboard tracks players' performance in the Grand Prix season      |
  |   via a points-based system. The Nitro Leaderboard tracks total Nitro   |
  |   Points earned during the Grand Prix season.                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Those that finish in the top 5% of either leaderboard will get the    |
  |   Champion Kart (if they don't have it already), and a brand new        |
  |   Signature Decal for the Back N. Time Grand Prix!                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   A peek at what's next.                                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Now that you know all that's coming with CTR's mad dash into the      |
  |   past with the Back N. Time Grand Prix, we also want to give a         |
  |   little glimpse into what the future holds. It's no secret that        |
  |   Spyro is crashing the Crash Bandicoot party in Grand Prix Season 3    |
  |   (and we can't wait to give you the full details on his season as we   |
  |   get closer to it).                                                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   But we're also excited to let fans know that they can expect more     |
  |   of their favorite characters from the Crash Bandicoot universe to     |
  |   join in on the Nitro-Fueled fun in the seasons after. Get ready for   |
